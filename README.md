# **Line Following Robot**

### **Requirements**
* Keil μVision 4
* Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad Evaluation Board
* 2 Wheel Smart Robot Car Chassis Kit
* 5 Channel IR Module
* L298 Motor Driver and 2 Motors
* Optocoupler 4N35, Regulators LM7805 and LM7812,  Capacitors 10uF

### **Overview**
In this project I implemented **Proportional Integral Differiential (PID)** algorithm in C language and built a simple line following robot car using a microcontroller named **TIVA C Series Evaluation Board**. The software used to write, compile and burn the code on microcontroller is **Keil μVision 4**.
